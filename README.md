Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
The Caesar Cipher algorithm works by shifting the characters in a message by a specified number of positions in the character set, 
effectively scrambling the text to protect it from unauthorized access. 
This project allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by inputting the text and a shift value of their choice.

Features: Character Set: The program supports a wide range of characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, spaces, and special symbols.
Encryption: Convert your plain text message into an encrypted cipher text using a shift key. 
Decryption: Reverse the encryption process by decrypting the cipher text back to its original form.
User Interaction: The program runs in a loop, allowing users to encrypt or decrypt multiple messages in one session.

How to Use: Run the Program: Execute the Python script. Choose Operation: Type 'encrypt' to encrypt a message or 'decrypt' to decrypt a cipher text. 
Enter Message: Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Set Shift Value: Enter the numerical shift value to determine how many positions each character should be moved in the character set.
Continue or Exit: After each operation, you can choose to continue encrypting/decrypting or exit the program.

Example: Encrypting: Input: "saheem" with a shift of -1.
Output: "rzgddl" Decrypting: Input: "rzgddl" with a shift of 3. Output: "saheem"

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand basic encryption techniques and Python programming.
Feel free to clone the repository and modify the code to experiment with different aspects of the Caesar Cipher.
